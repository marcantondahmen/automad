## Installation

The fastest way to get Automad up and running is to use Composer.

	composer create-project automad/automad .

Follow this [guide](https://automad.org/getting-started#composer) to finish the installation and get started quickly.    
Alternatively Automad can also be [installed manually](https://automad.org/getting-started#manual-installation).

## Documentation

However, I do not exclude at this point using parts of Automad's source in future projects under different licenses.
