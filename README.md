## Live Demo

In case you quickly want to try out Automad without setting up a server first, just check out the [live demo](https://try.automad.org) for free. There is no sign-up required and you can start exploring new features right in away in your personal demo instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that in order to keep hosting costs under control, all demos are running on **minimal hardware** and expire after one hour.

## Installation

Note that this repository only contains source code. Please follow the instructions below in order to install a fully bundled version of Automad using [Docker](https://github.com/automadcms/automad-docker) or [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/automad/automad).
It is also possible to manually [download](https://github.com/automadcms/automad-dist/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and [install](#manual-installation) Automad.

### Composer

The fastest way to get Automad up and running is to use [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/automad/automad).

```bash
composer create-project automad/automad . v2.x-dev
```

Follow this [guide](https://automad.org/version-2#getting-started) to finish the installation and get started quickly.

### Docker

It is also possible to run Automad in a [Docker](https://github.com/automadcms/automad-docker) container including **Nginx** and **PHP 8.3**.

```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 -v ./app:/app --name mysite automad/automad:v2
```

This will essentially make your site available at port `80` and mount a directory called `app` in the current working directory for data persistence.
A new user account for the Automad dashboard will be created automatically. The account details will be logged by the running container.
You can show these logs using the following command:

```bash
docker logs mysite
```

Your can now navigate to [localhost](http://localhost) to view your new site.

### Manual Installation

In case you are not able to use Docker or Composer, you can also deploy Automad manually.

1. Download a [distribution bundle](https://github.com/automadcms/automad-dist/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and move the
   unpacked content to the document root of your webserver.
2. Make sure the PHP process has the permissions to write to the document root and its subdirectories including all installed files.
3. Visit the `/dashboard` route of your site and create the first user.
