sys_cache: Cache

-

sys_cache_info: Caching is essential to speed up your site and should generally be enabled. However under some circumstances you might want to disable or clear your cache.

-

sys_cache_clear: Clear Cache

-

sys_cache_clear_info: Clearing the site cache forces a rescan for updated pages and files. This action will not remove any page files or images from the cache directory.

-

sys_cache_enable: Caching

-

sys_cache_monitor: The checking interval is

-

sys_cache_monitor_info: When caching is enabled, Automad will check regularly for changes in the file system. The frequency of those checks can be defined here.

-

sys_cache_lifetime: The cache lifetime is 

-

sys_cache_lifetime_info: All cached Automad data and pages have a maximum lifetime. After the lifetime of an object exceeds, its cache will be rebuilt when requested.   

-

sys_cache_purge: Purge Cache Directory

-

sys_cache_purge_info: In contrast to simply clearing the cache, purging the cache directory will also move all temporary files, deleted pages, update-backups and cached images to the temprary directory of the system. This will force a full rebuild of the image and page cache as well as a cleanup of all deleted pages. On most systems the temporary directory will be cleaned up automatically from time to time or on reboot. However, on some systems that directory has to be cleared manually.

-

sys_config: Edit Configuration File 

-

sys_config_warning: Note that only experienced users should edit the configuration file to avoid damage to your installation. In case something goes wrong, please delete the configuration file manually from your server in order to restore the default settings.

-

sys_debug: Debug

-

sys_debug_enable: Debug Mode

-

sys_debug_info: When debugging is enabled, all of Automad's processes will be logged to your browser's console. Debugging is only needed for development or troubleshooting and should be disabled in all other cases.

-

sys_headless: Headless

-

sys_headless_edit_info: The structure of the returned JSON data is controlled by a template. You can edit that template using Automad's built-in template language for customizing fields by using variables, objects and control structures.

-

sys_headless_enable: Headless Mode

-

sys_headless_info: Activating the headless mode turns Automad into a content management system focusing entirely on content creation without a presentation layer. While the Dashboard can still be used to manage content, all data and files are accessible via a read-only JSON API.

-

sys_language: Language

-

sys_language_info: There are several languages available for the Dashboard. The translations are created automatically. This feature is still in an experimental phase and therefore some translations might not be accurate.
