sys_cache: Cache

-

However under some circumstances you might want to disable or clear your cache.

-

-

sys_cache_purge_info: In contrast to clearing the cache, purging will move all files and images from the **cache** directory into the system **temp** directory.   
This will force a full rebuild of the image and page cache as well as a cleanup of all deleted pages.          
On most systems the **temp** directory will be cleaned up by the system automatically from time to time or on reboot. 
However, on some systems that directory has to be cleaned up manually.
